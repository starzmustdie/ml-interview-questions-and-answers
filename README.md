# Answers to Chip Huyen's Machine Learning Interview Questions

This repository contains my solutions to [“Introduction to Machine Learning Interviews”](https://huyenchip.com/ml-interviews-book/) by Chip Huyen. The section and question numbering has been structured to align with the original book by Chip Huyen in order to maintain consistency.
